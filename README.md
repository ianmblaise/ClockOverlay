# ClockOverlay
Just a small project that shows a clock over League of Legends client. Nothing fancy. Users can control the color of the clock's font, and the position of it. 

# Details
Pretty simple, I tried to keep the presence of the program discreet. In your task tray there will be an Icon that should (hopefully) resemble a clock.
Left click it to open a dialog. Here you can choose to either change settings or exit the application. There are only three settings which
can be changed at this time. 

|Setting      |Description    |
|:-----------:|:------------- |
|    Top      | Equivalent to the Y value on a two dimensional grid. |
|    Left     | Equivalent to the X value on a two dimensional grid. |
|    Color    | Hexadecimal representation of a color.               |

# Thoughts
Probably won't have too many additions to this tool, just going to clear up the bugs and add a few more settings to control the font size and style, and maybe one to add a startup entry to registry / startup folder as well. 

Fin.
